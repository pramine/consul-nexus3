# Local Nexus 3 Proxy

A local Nexus 3 proxy for my laptop whose purpose is to cache dependencies for
docker containers and locally provisioned servers.  I do a lot of provisioning
of infrastructure locally on my laptop.  This Nexus 3 instance is to help
alleviate the need for me to download a lot of duplicate dependencies from the
internet across the local servers I provision.

Different ways I provision locally include:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Vagrant

Example configurations:
